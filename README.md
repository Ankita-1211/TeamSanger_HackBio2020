# TeamSanger_HackBio2020
This Repo belongs to team Sanger members to collaborate on the assignments
This README.md contains information about the names of the members of this team Sanger. All members are required to add their names, as well add informaton about the **softwares** they used and if there are dependencies needed state them clearly.
For instance: I used **Python 3.7** to generate my script_wgatua.py. So to execute the script successfully you need to install python 3.7 in your computer.
